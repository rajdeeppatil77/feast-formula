**Project:** FEAST FORMULA  
**Domain:** Artificial Intelligence & Full Stack Web Development  
**Academic Year:** 2025-2026

## 1. ABSTRACT
Feast Formula is an integrated smart food ordering platform that bridges the gap between nutrition, health, and commerce. Unlike traditional platforms, it incorporates an AI-driven Health Risk Prediction engine (RandomForest) to analyze user vitals and suggest lifestyle changes. Additionally, it features a Real-time Fraud Detection system (LogisticRegression) to secure transactions. This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end implementation of a modern web application using React, Flask, and Scikit-Learn.

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Existing food delivery apps focus solely on logistics and sales, often ignoring the health impact on consumers. Furthermore, online payment fraud remains a critical challenge. There is a need for a system that not only delivers food but also acts as a health companion and ensures secure financial transactions.

## 3. PROPOSED SYSTEM
The system consists of three main modules:
1.  **Commerce Module**: User-friendly ordering, cart management, and tracking.
2.  **Health AI Module**: Takes user inputs (Age, BMI, Habits) to predict potential risks (Diabetes, Heart Disease).
3.  **Security Module**: Analyzes transaction patterns (Time, Amount, Location) to flag fraudulent activities.

## 4. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
-   **Frontend**: React.js / HTML5 Templates (UI/UX)
-   **Backend**: Python Flask (REST API)
-   **ML Layer**: Scikit-Learn (Model Training & Inference)
-   **Database**: SQLite/MySQL (Data Persistence)

## 5. MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS
| Module | Algorithm | Accuracy Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Health Prediction | Random Forest Classifier | > 85% |
| Diet Recommendation | Content-Based Filtering | N/A |
| Fraud Detection | Logistic Regression | > 90% |

## 6. CONCLUSION
Feast Formula successfully integrates health awareness into the food ordering lifecycle, providing a safer and healthier user experience.
